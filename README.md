# Indian Lok Sabha Election Results Analysis using SQL

## 📌 Project Overview
This project analyzes the Indian Lok Sabha election results using SQL. The goal is to derive meaningful insights from election data by querying large datasets. The analysis focuses on voting trends, constituency-wise performance, party-wise outcomes, and key factors influencing election results such as voter turnout and winning margins.

## 📂 Dataset
The dataset contains information on:
- Constituencies and their respective states
- Political parties
- Candidates and their votes
- Voter turnout statistics
- Winning and losing margins
- Historical election results

## 🔍 Key Analysis Performed
1. **Overall Election Trends** - Total votes, participation rate, and major parties' performance.
2. **Constituency-Wise Performance** - Identifying strongholds and closely contested seats.
3. **Party-Wise Outcomes** - Vote share, seats won, and dominance in specific regions.
4. **Winning Margins** - Close contests vs. landslide victories.
5. **Voter Turnout Insights** - Analyzing turnout patterns across states and constituencies.
6. **Historical Comparison** - Performance trends over multiple election cycles.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- **SQL** (for querying and data analysis)
- **MySQL** (or any preferred database management system)
- **Power Bi** (for visualization)

## 📜 SQL Queries Used
- Data extraction and filtering
- Aggregation and grouping
- Joins (inner, left, right) to merge datasets
- Window functions for ranking and percentage calculations
- Subqueries and CTEs for complex analysis

## 🚀 How to Use
1. Import the dataset into your SQL database.
2. Run the provided SQL scripts in sequence:
3. Analyze the query results and generate insights.
4. Use Power BI/Tableau for visualization.
